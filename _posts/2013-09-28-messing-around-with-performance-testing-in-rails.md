I've just started playing with performance testing in rails and it's great! For the moment I'm just using the standard test-unit performance test to measure wall time. 
but the rake test:profile outputs are really interesting. It's reminding me of my time working stormwater and river modelling as a Civil Engineer. Lots of profiles 
and graphs to analyse in order to pinpoint bottlenecks in a pipe system or river course (which would result in flooding). pipes == stack, flooding==slow loading, bottleneck == bottleneck. 

It's actually the first time I've seen a REAL parallel between my old type of engineering and my new one outside of vague general areas such as  "Problem Solving" and "Project Management"

I've been only happy since I made the change from Civil to programming but it's nice to see that there's a similarity and I'm kind of excited about getting more stuck in :)
