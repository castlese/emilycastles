<p>I&#39;ve been threatening to start a small blog for ages - mostly for my own benefit to keep track of the things I learn along the way, things I need to refer to frequently and and mistakes I make. 
I also find that I go to lots of talks and events and would like to keep track of any small nuggets of knowledge I learn, links to slides etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been wanting to try out nitrous.io for a while now and I figured this would be a great way to start. Nitrous is a service which provides a development environment
in the cloud (wow, I love that phrase so much!). You can set up a Rails, Node.js, Python/Django or Go box and access it from any browser, anywhere. It&#39;s great!</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s going to be particularly useful for this site as I&#39;ve decided to run it using Jekyll - which means instead of having a CMS to update blog posts and content, 
the content is written statically. This is particularly useful for a developer as I feel Wordpress and other equivalents would be way too heavy for my needs given that I 
can edit the code relatively quickly.</p>

<p>Setting up nitrous is really easy, just go to <a href="http://nitrous.io">notrous.io</a> and follow the instructions on there. I set up a small rails box - with just 768MB
of RAM and 1000MB of storage. That&#39;s fine for now. It works really quickly and I can always pay for more memory if needed. Link the box with your github and you&#39;ll be able to 
push your project to your remote github repository. </p>

<p>Jekyll was also pretty easy to set up. I haven&#39;t used markdown or liquid formats before so I&#39;ll have a bit to play around with there but it doesn&#39;t look all that hard</p>

<p>Instead of manually adding new blog post files, I&#39;ve gone with the suggestion of <a href="http://yeswejekyll.com">yeswejekyll.com</a> and have included a rake task to create new posts:</p>

<p>rake post title=&quot;A Title&quot; [date=&quot;2012-02-09&quot;] [tags=[tag1, tag2]]</p>

<p>Mostly the hard part for me is deciding on colours, fonts and styles - I get lost in that stuff so</p>
